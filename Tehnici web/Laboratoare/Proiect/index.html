            <p><span class = "important_in_p">George Raymond Richard Martin</span>(born George Raymond Martin; September 20, 1948), also known as GRRM, is an American novelist and short story writer, screenwriter, and television producer. He writes the series of epic fantasy novels A Song of Ice and Fire, which was adapted into the HBO series Game of Thrones (2011â€“2019).</p>
            <p>Martin began selling science fiction short stories professionally in 1970, at age 21. His first sale was "The Hero", sold to Galaxy magazine and published in its February 1971 issue; other sales soon followed. His first story to be nominated for the Hugo Award and Nebula Awards was "With Morning Comes Mistfall", published in 1973 in Analog magazine. In 1975 his story "...for a single yesterday" about a post-apocalyptic timetripper was selected for inclusion in Epoch, a science fiction anthology edited by Roger Elwood and Robert Silverberg.</p>
            <p>In 1987, Martin published a collection of short horror stories in Portraits of His Children.In 1991, Martin briefly returned to writing novels. He had grown frustrated that his TV pilots and screenplays were not getting made[50] and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.</p>
            <p><span class = "important_in_p" >A Song of Ice and Fire</span>  is a series of epic fantasy novels. George, started working at the first volume, <span class = "highlighted_volume">A Game of Thrones</span>, in 1991, and it was published in 1996. Martin, who initially envisioned the series as a trilogy, has published five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent volume of the series, <span class = "highlighted_volume">A Dance with Dragons</span>, was published in 2011 and took Martin six years to write. He is currently writing the sixth novel, The Winds of Winter. A seventh novel A Dream of Spring is planned.</p>
